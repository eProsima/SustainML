SustainML
*********

Application Aware, Life-Cycle Oriented Model-Hardware Co-Design Framework for Sustainable, Energy Efficient ML
Systems project.
*SustainML* is a framework and an associated toolkit that will foster energy efficiency throughout the whole
life-cycle of ML applications: from the design and exploration phase that includes exploratory iterations of training,
testing and optimizing different system versions through the final training of the production systems (which often
involves huge amounts of data, computation and epochs) and (where appropriate) continuous online re-training during
deployment for the inference process.
The framework will optimize the ML solutions based on the application tasks, across levels from hardware to model
architecture.
It will also collect both previously scattered efficiency-oriented research, as well as novel Green-AI methods.

AI developers from all experience levels can make use of the framework through its emphasis on human-centric
interactive transparent design and functional knowledge cores, instead of the common blackbox and fully automated
optimization approaches in AutoML.
